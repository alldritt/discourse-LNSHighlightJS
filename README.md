# discourse-LNSHighlightJS

**UPDATE**: I've stopped using this plugin in favour of customizing my Discourse template to introduce "Edit with Script Debugger" buttons.  See [here](https://forum.latenightsw.com/t/open-in-script-debugger-links-gone/682/13) for further details.

A [discourse](http://www.discourse.org) plugin that introduces a hacked version of highlight.js to provide 'Open in Script Debugger' links for AppleScript code blocks.  This plugin is used in the [Script Debugger Support forum](http://forum.latenightsw.com).
